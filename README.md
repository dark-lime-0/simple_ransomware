# Ransomware Script (Educational)
This script demonstrates a simple ransomware implementation for educational purposes. It encrypts all files within a specified directory and its subdirectories using Fernet symmetric encryption from the cryptography library.

## Usage :
### Encryption:

Run `enc_file.py`
Specify the directory containing the files to encrypt.
A key `thekey.key` will be generated for decryption.
### Decryption:

Run `dec_file.py`
Specify the directory containing the encrypted files.
Use the `thekey.key` file for decryption.
### Important:
* This script is for educational purposes only.
* Do not use this script on any system or file without explicit authorization.
* Always handle encryption keys securely and responsibly.
